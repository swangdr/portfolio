      <p>
         You know that saying, “Id Rather be Fishing?” Yea, that would be me and
         I usually am fishing. But I really love electronics and software and
         I’m not ready for the pasture. So I’m dibbling and dabbling here and
         there. Some people would call this a second, third or forth career.
         While I can’t keep up with all the young whipper/snappers out there I
         can offer a vast amount of knowledge and experience. Currently active
         with AI development and providing a SAAS tool.
